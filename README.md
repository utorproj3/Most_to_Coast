# Most_to_Coast

## Description: 
This app will reduce travel planning time. Creating a time schedule for the trip would be a little troublesome to some people and sometimes have no clue where one should go and how they should plan. This app will be the solution to those problems.

## Heroku Deployment: 
https://peaceful-journey-57215.herokuapp.com/main

## Product Pitch:


## Description:
* This program is designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations from a non-relational database on a front-end Travel Plan sharing Website.
* Backend: The back-end of this project was completed using Node.js, express server, Mongo database, npm Mongoose and tested in a backend environment (Apollo Server).
* Frontend: This front-end of this project was completed using React, css, bootstrap rendered with graphQL requests.

## Built By:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* express.js
* npm (dotenv)
* Path 
* React & react router
* MongoDB (Mongoose)
* Apollo Server (express)
* GQL
* Apollo Client
* JWT
* Nodemon & concurrently & react router dom


## Built-Logic:
1. Write out DB Models
2. Relations of DB models (Associations) drawn in an ER Diagram.
3. Work on queries and mutations on backend && add JWT Authentications.
4. Once routes on backend are tested (graphql), go to frontend JS files (react) and connect queries && mutations from backend to the frontend elements using react states.
5. styling (stylesheets).

## Models && Associations Diagram (ER Diagram): 
-This is a middleman diagram to help us to convert our business idea into a database schema.

## How to Install:
* Open Gitbash/terminal, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from the "Most_to_Coast" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
* In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
* Once the clone is successful, navigate to the root directory of this repo.
* Enter `npm run install` into the terminal to install all dependencies linked in the `package.json` file (both client and server sides).

## How to initialize the database:
1. Create a `.env` file in your `server` directory, as the seeding the database requires connection to your database.

2. (optional) In terminal, enter `npm run seed` to feed the database with test seeds.

## How to Use:
1. Cloud: Open the deployed heroku link, the project is hosted on the cloud and ready to be used!

2. Local Machine: type `npm run develop` in your gitbash shell and the react app would be automatically opened.
